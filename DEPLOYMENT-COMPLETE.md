## 📊 **What to Monitor - Your Analysis Checklist**

### **🌊 1. Predictive Cascade Alerts**
**Look for these log messages:**
```
🌊 PREDICTIVE CASCADE ALERT [timestamp]
   🎯 Symbol: SPKUSDT
   ⚡ Energy Z-Score: X.XXσ
   🔮 Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   ⏱️ Estimated Lead Time: XXs
```

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Lead Time**: Time between predictive alert and subsequent Trifecta signal
- **Z-Score**: Higher values (>4.0σ) should correlate with stronger subsequent moves
- **Confirmation Rate**: % of predictive alerts followed by Trifecta signals within 60s

### **💰 2. Shadow Trading Performance**
**Monitor these metrics:**
```
📈 SHADOW ORDER EXECUTED: [position-id]
   Type: SHORT/LONG | Size: $1000.00
   Fill Price: $X.XXXXXX (Slippage: $X.XXXXXX)
   Latency: 50ms | Fee: $X.XXXX
```

**Strategy Comparison:**
- **Wavelet Strategy**: P&L from PREDICTIVE_CASCADE_ALERT signals
- **Trifecta Strategy**: P&L from TRIFECTA_CONVICTION_SIGNAL signals
- **Expected**: Wavelet should show higher P&L due to earlier entry

### **📈 3. Feature Pipeline Health**
**Check for:**
```
📊 Feature Pipeline: Real-time market microstructure analysis
✅ Features Calculated: XXXX
✅ Avg Latency: XX.Xms
✅ Data Points: XXXX
```

**Critical Features:**
- **OFI (Order Flow Imbalance)**: Input for wavelet analysis
- **Ask/Bid Ratio**: Core SentryCoin signal
- **Momentum**: Price change calculation
- **Calculation Latency**: Should be <10ms
